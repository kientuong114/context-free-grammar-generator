#This is an example file

#Comments start with "#": these lines, along with empty lines, will be ignored
#The format is typical of the Backus-Naur form. For example:
#Left-hand side::="First production"|"Second "<any non terminal character>"production"|"Third production"
#The number of production is variable and can be indefinitely large. Each production must be separated by a "|" character (This can be changed in the bnf_to_json.py file)
#Note that the left-hand side does not have quotes around, while terminal pieces of the production must be sorrounded by double quotes.
#Non terminal pieces must be sorrounded by angled brackets.

#To convert to json give the following arguments in the command, following the script name:
#OUTPUT_FILE, NAME_OF_GRAMMAR (Can be anything you like), VERSION (same as before), AUTHOR

#This example generates the language {a^n b^n|n>=1} U {a^n b^(2n)|n>=1}

S::=a <S1>b|a<S2>bb
S1::=ab|a<S1>b
